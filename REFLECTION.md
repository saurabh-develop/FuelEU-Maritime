# Reflection — Using AI Agents for Development

Building the FuelEU Maritime Compliance Platform using **AI-assisted development** taught me how to effectively collaborate with intelligent tools.

## What I Learned
AI agents are best used as **coding collaborators**, not replacements. They can draft code structures, suggest fixes, and even visualize architecture — but still require human validation. I learned to critically read AI outputs and understand every line before merging.

## Efficiency Gains
- Reduced setup and debugging time.
- Generated Prisma schema and Express layers.


## Challenges
AI occasionally produced outdated syntax or duplicated entities (e.g., PlantUML aliases). I learned that **verifying generated code early** prevents large downstream errors. Context retention was also critical — giving precise prompts improved results drastically.

## Improvements for Next Time
- Use AI agents with **automated test generation** to validate outputs faster.  
- Incorporate **CI/CD validation** for Prisma and TypeScript builds.  
- Explore **domain-specific prompting** for maritime regulation logic.

Overall, AI agents amplified productivity, especially in the architecture, documentation, and debugging phases — transforming a complex compliance system into a rapid, structured build process.
